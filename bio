 Hi, I'm Naga Shiva Chinmayee Kondagadapa â€” a passionate Data Scientist and MLOps enthusiast with a focus on Generative AI. Currently, Iâ€™m learning and building projects that bridge the gap between Machine Learning, AI, and real-world production systems. I'm always excited about deploying models at scale and optimizing data pipelines!

**Currently Working On:**
- MLOps pipelines with CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Docker for robust model deployment.
- Exploring Generative AI techniques such as GPT, Stable Diffusion, and LangChain.
- Building and deploying machine learning models using cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.

**Learning:**
- Advanced **MLOps** practices, including model monitoring, orchestration, and automated workflows.
- **Generative AI** tools such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, and deep learning frameworks for text-to-image and NLP.
- Improving my skills in **cloud computing** (AWS, GCP) and **DevOps** for scalable ML solutions.

**Experience:**
- Former Software Developer and Data Integration Specialist with a focus on building data-driven applications and optimizing data workflows.
- Gaining hands-on experience in **MLOps**, **ETL pipelines**, and **cloud-based deployments**.
